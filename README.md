## Description

Fragile - An app to improve your mental health. 



## User Stories

- **404:** As a user I get to see a 404 page with a feedback message if I try to reach a page that does not exist so that I know it's my fault.
- **Homepage** - As a "anonymous" user you'll be able to log in and sign up. If you are logged in, you'll be able to see all your subscriptions and get inspired to find new subscriptions. 
- **Signup:**  As a user you are introduced to the app and as a first time user you'll be guided trough the  the experience of the app. 
- **Login:** As a user I can login to the platform so that I can access my current "paths" and view content and go to my profile.  
- **Logout:** As a logged in user I can logout from the platform so no one else can use it.
- **Profile Page**: As a logged in user I can visit my profile page so that I can see my "notes". 
- **View Path:** As a logged in user I can see the subscriptions I have taken, I can see earlier notes that I have written and I can create a new entry.
- **New journal:** As a logged in user I can add a journal to my chosen path. There will be an "guided session", and after that i can enter my response, and post either public or private. 
- **Public journals :** As a user I can see other peoples entries to the "guided session" I have just completed, I can then like the notes

## Backlog
